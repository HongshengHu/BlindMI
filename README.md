# BlindMI

This is the code for "Practical Blind Membership Inference Attack via Differential Comparison". We are trying to implement an MI attack, called BlindMI.

## Requirements
+ Python3.7
+ Tensorflow 2.1.0
+ Tensorflow Datasets
+ Scikit-learn
+ tqdm
+ Numpy
+ Pandas
+ Pillow
+ OpenCV
## Code Usage
dataLoader.py is to provide the data for other modules.

### Train TargetModel:
```bash
#Train TargetModel as following:
python TargetModel.py CIFAR ResNet50
```
The model weights will be saved in the following folder: weights/Target. And you could change the dataset's name and model's name, which is included in dataLoader.py and ModelUtil.py seperately.

### BlindMI-Diff-w Attack:
```bash
#Train TargetModel as following:
python TargetModel.py CIFAR ResNet50
```
This attack is based on a non-Member gernerated function and only use 20 non-Members generated by us to extraly prode the target model.
You could use the other Datasets and Target Models trained in last section. The evaluation results will be output directly as it finishes.
